<h1>Code Commenting</h1>
<p>Code should be carefully commented.  You might have to review or reuse your code at a future time when your current thought processes have been long forgotten.  Your coworkers might have to pick up where you left off, perhaps after you've left the company.  Your comments might even be used in a legal proceeding (for instance, a lawsuit or as an established license agreement).  At the least, comments help organize a program's code or a solution method.</p>

<p>In addition to adequate line comments, consider including a more prominent comment block before defining a function, as follows:<br/>
<div id="code">
###########################################################<br/>
# &ensp;Function Name: myAmazingFunction<br/>
#<br/>
#  &ensp;Function Description: This function does amazing things<br/>
#   &emsp; such as thing1, thing2, thing3...using such and such<br/>
#   &emsp; equations.  Beware of its limitations in this, that, <br/>
#   &emsp; and the other....<br/>
#<br/>
#  &ensp;Input: Your birth-date<br/>
#<br/>
#  &ensp;Output: Your age, days until your next birthday<br/>
###########################################################<br/>
</div></p>

<p>You should also include a prominent comment block when defining a class in object oriented programming.  Such a block might include the class's purpose, how to use it (public functions), and its limitations.</p>
