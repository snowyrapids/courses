<h1>Code Style</h1>
<p>Style guides improve code readability and consistency.  Students' coding assignments should adhere to the following style rules:
<ul>
<li>Variable names should begin with a lower-case letter followed by letters, numerals, and the underscore "_" character.  Multiple words in a variable name should start with a capital letter; for example, <em id="code">thisIsMyDescriptive_Variable</em>.</li>
<li>Function and object names follow the same convention as variables.</li>
<li>Constants should be all capital letters, underscore, and numbers.  For instance, <em id="code">THIS_IS_A_CONSTANT</em>.</li>
<li>Class names (not objects) should have every word beginning with a capital letter.  For example, <em id="code">ThisIsAClassName</em>.</li>
<li>Variables and numbers mingled with operators should be separated by a space, as in <em id="code">variable3 = variable1 + variable2</em> or as in <em id="code">variable1 >= variable2</em>.  The exceptions are multiplication, division, and exponentiation, which might be more readable as <em id="code">variable1*variable2 + variable3</em> or as <em id="code">variable1 * variable2^10</em>.  (You might have to paste these examples into a text editor to more easily see the spaces between operators.)</li>
<li>Do not cram too many programming commands on one line or obfuscate your code. Generally you should only write one code statement per line.</li>
<li>Make good use of indentation.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Additionally, there are some programming conventions that should be followed.
<ul>
<li>Variables/objects should generally be initialized/instantiated at the beginning of the scope in which they operate.  If they apply to the whole program, they should be initialized at the beginning of the program.  If they apply only to a function, they should be initialized at the beginning of the function.</li>
<li>There should be only one entry point and one exit point to a program or a function (e.g., only one <em id="code">return</em> in a function, located on the last line of said function.)</li>
<li>Non-member functions should not directly access most of a class's/object's data.  Use public member "get" and "set" functions instead.</li>
<li>Classes should include constructor functions.</li>
</ul></p>
