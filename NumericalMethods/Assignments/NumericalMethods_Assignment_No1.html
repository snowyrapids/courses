<h1>Numerical Methods Assignment #1</h1>
<p>To receive credit for this assignment, you must demonstrate to your professor <em>in person</em> (and obtain acknowledgment) that your computer can correctly run the following files:<br/>
<ul>
<li><a href="ME342_testNotebook.py" target="_blank">ME342_testNotebook.py</a> &ndash; The python test script</li>
<li><a href="ME342_testNotebook.ipynb" target="_blank">ME342_testNotebook.ipynb</a> &ndash; The Jupyter Notebook test file</li>
<li>Note: You might have to right-click on the link and select "Save link as...".</li>
</ul></p>
<p>
The software and libraries to run these files must be installed on your personally-owned or managed computer.  This could be either your laptop, your remotely-accessed desktop, or a virtual machine running on such in which you have installed the requisite software/libraries yourself.  Online web services are not acceptable.
</p>

<p>To run the python file (ending in ".py"), the following software and libraries must be installed:
<ul>
<li>Python 3.x (version 3.4 or newer)</li>
<li><em>NumPy</em> library</li>
<li><em>matplotlib</em> plotting library</li>
<li><em>SymPy</em> symbolics library</li>
</ul>

To run the Jupyter Notebook file (ending in ".ipynb"), the following must additionally be installed:
<ul>
<li>pip3 (most likely needed)</li>
<li>jupyter</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>You could also install Python 3 and the libraries as a package, such as Anaconda (huge) or Miniconda (not quite as huge).  This method might be easier for many users.</p>
