<h1>Numerical Methods Assignment #2</h1>
<h2>Simulated Coin Tosses</h2>
<p>
For this assignment you will program a simulated coin toss in Python 3 using Jupyter.  The number of coin tosses should be assigned to a variable at the beginning, and the results should be displayed at the end.  Such results include the numbers and percentages of heads and tails.  To obtain full credit the following must be included in your notebook:
<ul>
<li>Adequate commenting (see the commenting link on the Language Resources page)</li>
<li>Correct use of style (see the style guide link on the Language Resources page)</li>
<li>The coin result must be determined by a random number generator (check out the "random" library that should have been included with your installation)</li>
<li>Your simulation must include a function that you created, a branching statement, and well-named variables</li>
<li>The results must be printed as output to the cell, e.g., <em id="code">print("Number of heads:", headCount)</em>.  Be certain to include the percent sign % on the printed percentages.</li>
<li>No unnecessary or unused code</li>
<li>Your simulator must work correctly</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The Jupyter notebook template for this assignment can be downloaded <a href="CoinToss_template.ipynb">here</a>.  You will submit your completed notebook file to the appropriate drop-box in I-Learn.</p>
