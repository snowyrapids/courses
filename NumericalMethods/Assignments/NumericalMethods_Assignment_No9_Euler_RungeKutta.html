<h1>Numerical Methods Assignment #9</h1>
<!--<p>Caution: Carefully read and observe all of the assignment instructions so that you do not lose points for missed requirements.</p>-->
<h2>Solving ODE's with Euler and Runge-Kutta Methods</h2>
<p>This assignment will be done only in Python 3 with Jupyter-Notebook.  You will use the template provided <a href="ODE_template.ipynb">here</a>.</p>

<p>You will create an ODE toolbox with a class; it must contain a member function/method for both the Euler's Method and the 4th order Runge-Kutta Method.  The differential equation's function (everything on the right-hand-side of the $\frac{dy}{dx}=f(x,y)$) must be passed as an object parameter to the Euler and Runge-Kutta methods along with any other pertinent parameters.  You must preserve code encapsulation by instantiating the ODE toolbox only once for the entire assignment and by avoiding outside alteration of the <em>toolbox's</em> member data (either directly or through getter/setter functions).</p>

<p>After solving the ODE with both the Euler and the 4th-Order Runge-Kutta methods, you must plot their respective results against the exact analytical solution using <em>matplotlib</em>.  Your plot must additionally contain a legend and appropriate axes titles.</p>

<p>The assigned ODE that you must solve is as follows:
<ul>
<li>$\frac{dy}{dx}=$<em>++++++ Place the Equation Here ++++++</em></li>
<li>$x_0=$</li>
<li>$x_f=$</li>
<li>$y_0=$</li>
<li>The number of steps is 10</li>
</ul></p>

<h3><em>Also</em> be certain that in your assignment you...</h3>

<!--<li>Submit your assignment as a zip file.</li>-->
<li>Correctly use style (see the style guide link on the Language Resources page), adequate commenting (see the commenting link on the Language Resources page; don't forget class and function comment blocks), and well-named variables.</li>
<li>Remove unnecessary or unused code.</li>
<li>Name your submission file according to the naming convention on the Numerical Methods Assignments page.</li>
</ul></p>
