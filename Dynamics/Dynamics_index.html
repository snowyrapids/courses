<h2>Calculators</h2>
<p>Any calculator that does <i>not</i> have a "QWERTY" keyboard is allowed for this class.  If your calculator does have a "QWERTY" keyboard (which is rare), then talk to your professor.
Here are some <a href="../Common/CalculatorResources.html">calculator resources</a>.</p>

<h2>Engineering &#38; Math Software</h2>
<p>Students can use engineering and math software to solve homework problems.  Be judicious in their use, however, as they will not be available during the exams.  Resources for software are located <a href="../Common/EngineeringAndMathSoftwareResources.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Homework Assignments</h2>
<p>Homework assignments must utilize the BYU-Idaho ME Department's homework standard insofar as it is applicable, whether done by hand or computer/printed.  This requirement includes the following aspects:

<ul>
	<li>One problem per page</li>
	<li>Assignment/problem number, name, and date must be written <em>at the top of the page</em> along with the page number out of the total pages (e.g., "pp. 2/8")</li>
	<li>Given/Find/Solution blocks</li>
	<li>Engineering graph paper (applies only to handwritten work)</li>
	<li>Clear handwriting and organization</li>
	<li>Equation referencing, especially internally (equations you've made in your solution)</li>
	<li>Notes and commenting ("document" your solution)</li>
</ul>
